      <p>
        The structure of XHTML documents are simple. Any command that is issued, must be closed to
        ensure correct execution. If commands are issued in sequence, then the last issued command
        must be terminated first.
      </p>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="code-header">
          <span>HTML</span>
          <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
        </div>
        <pre><code>&lt;b&gt;this is bold
&lt;i&gt;this is bold and italic&lt;/i&gt;
this is bold again&lt;/b&gt;
this is plain text
</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        There are no if.. then.. else.. statements in XHTML, therefore it is not a programming
        language. In fact, XHTML is a member of the SGML family. SGML stands for Standard
        Generalized Markup Language, which was created by IBM for their electronic typewriter. Based
        on this fact, we know that XHTML is a publishing language, with the main purpose of
        controlling page layout.
