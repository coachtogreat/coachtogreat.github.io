      <h3 class="section-title">How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        XHTML documents is processed by software and hardware deviced called parsers. The most
        common parser are browsers, even though there are other types.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the processing, the parser will watch for the ' &lt; ' which signifies the beginning
        of a markup. The parser will then enter into dictionary mode and search it's database for
        commands it recognizes. If the command following the ' &lt; ' is not recognized, it will be
        considered as an error and will be ignored.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the command is recognized, the parser will set a new mode for the content following the
        command. The parser will then look for the ' &gt; ' which tells the parser to execute the
        command received. If the command was recognized, the parser will execute it until it find
        another ' &lt; ' sign and check if it is a new command or a closing command for the
        currently executed one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since some browsers are so 'wise' , it often happens that the browser at a certain point
        assume that the command is closed, even though there are no closing command. This is the
        reason that when an XHTML document contains error and commands are not terminated carefully,
        different browsers can produce different results for a single document.
